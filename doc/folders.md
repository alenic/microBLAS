# microBLAS's directory structure

In the root folder:
  * **include**: Inlcude files
  * **src**: Source files
  * **test**: Unit tests and integration tests
  * **benchmark**: Benchmark tests
  * **obj**: Object files generated by the compiler
  * **lib**: Dynamic and static libraries generated by the compiler

The microBLAS library can have different implementations, for example:
  * **PC**: a general version for Personal Computer, with loop unrolled code
  * **Arduino**: a version for Arduino
  * **Other**: other implementations that preserve the directory structure of the project.
